						<div class="text_bold"><b>12.04.2014: Odyssey Web Browser 1.24</b></div>
						<ul>
							<li>Updated to <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/" target="_blank">WebKit</a> r161078 (January 2014).</li>
							<li>Updated to OpenSSL 1.0.1g (which improves the SSL test at <a href="https://www.howsmyssl.com/" target="_blank">https://www.howsmyssl.com/)</a>.</li>
							<li>Compiled with GCC 4.7.3, since WebKit now relies strongly on C++11 features.</li>
							<li>Fixed an issue with large file support in CURL (fixes mail.one settings validation, for instance).</li>
							<li>Enabled WebP support again, it seems it had been disabled at some point.</li>
							<li>Enabled RequestAnimationFrame HTML5 feature.</li>

						</ul>
						<div class="text_bold"><b>20.12.2013: Odyssey Web Browser 1.22</b></div>
						<ul>
							<li>Fixed the slowness issue with topsites, when adblock was enabled. In that case, the generated screenshot data: URI (which is basically the screenshot raw data encoded as base64) was matched against the rules in adblock, which was obviously very slow.</li>
							<li>For security reasons, file:/// URL couldn't be accessed from topsites. Fixed as well.</li>
						</ul>
						<div class="text_bold"><b>12.12.2013: Odyssey Web Browser 1.21</b></div>
						<ul class="list_nested2">
							<li><b>Core:</b></li>
						</ul>
						<ul>
							<li>Updated to <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/" target="_blank">WebKit</a> r155188 (October 2013) : big changes (and thus regressions :)) happened in many parts of WebKit since previous Odyssey release (clipboard, drag'n'drop, network, javascript, inspector, c++0x requirements, ...). They should hopefully all be addressed.</li>
							<li>Updated to the new Webinspector layout.</li>
							<li>Fixed the layout of the FTP listing, so that the rows don't use all the available vertical space.</li>
							<li>Fixed a crash with self-disposing &lt;select&gt; objects (e.g priority cycle in MLDonkey Web interface).</li>
							<li>Localstorage databases (conf/localstorage/#?.localstorage) were not released at exit, which prevented from deleting them manually.</li>
							<li>Disabled non functional HTML5 MediaSource (it should help with some non-working YouTube links in HTML5 mode).</li>
							<li>Fixed a bug with the "view source code" function that would sometimes just show a blank view.</li>
							<li>The mimetype actions would not always be triggered properly in some cases (mainly because of redirections or content-disposition header). The response URL (or content-disposition filename if available) is now used when extension matching is needed.</li>
							<li>Added more common mimetype extensions in mimetype default configuration.</li>
							<li>Fixed a potential race condition at webview closing.</li>
						</ul>
						<ul class="list_nested2">

							<li>Added a status icon to indicate if userscripts are running on a given page. The bubble help on this icon also shows which userscripts are actually running.</li>
							<li>In bookmarks window, quicklinks favicons and URL are now displayed, to make it easier to create and identify title-less quick links.</li>
							<li>Added support for multiple selection with file input elements.</li>
							<li>Show FTP URL as window/tab title, instead of a blank title.</li>
							<li>In image views, show the image filename instead of "unnamed title".</li>
							<li>Implemented HTML5 ColorChooser dialog, using MUI Colorwheel.</li>

							<li>Updated to ffmpeg from 27.11.2013.</li>

							<li>Audio-only media could sometimes report a null duration : in practice, it fixes a hard crash with Facebook chat audio notifications.</li>

						</ul>
						<ul class="list_nested2">

						<ul class="list_nested2">
							<li><b>Spellchecker:</b></li>
						</ul>
						<ul>
							<li>Misspelled words are now underlined in red instead of black.</li>
						</ul>
						<ul class="list_nested2">
							<li><b>Scripts:</b></li>

							<li>Updated to Cairo 1.12 and Pixman 0.24.4: gives about 40% speedup in rendering.</li>
							<li>Updated to ICU 4.9.1: the data files are now stored externally in PROGDIR:resource/icudt49b/ to save some memory. Make sure to copy them if you update (a requester will warn you if you don't).</li>
							<li>Updated to OpenSSL 1.0.0j.</li>
							<li>Updated to Curl 7.25.0.</li>
							<li>Updated to FFMPEG GIT from 13.05.2012.</li>

							<li>Fixed a crash issue with the <a href="http://imp.free.fr/" target="_blank">imp.free.fr</a> webmail (old version). It was a deadly combination of the 417 status code handling and frame disposal.</li>

							<li>In middle mouse button scrolling mode, releasing button over a link would open the link.</li>

							<li>Hide panels when switching a webview to fullscreen mode and restore state when switching back.</li>

							<li>Fixed YouTube HTML5 fullscreen mode (Youtube_Fullscreen_Fix.js).</li>
							<li>Updated youtube.js.</li>
						</ul>
						<div class="text_bold"><b>- 05.08.2011: Odyssey Web Browser 1.14 (July 2011)</b></div>
						<ul>
							<li>Changed the name to "Odyssey Web Browser". Like it or hate it, but you can still call it OWB, anyway. :)</li>
							<li>Updated to <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/" target="_blank">WebKit</a> r91657 (July 2011).</li>
							<li>Updated to Curl 7.21.7.</li>
							<li>Use OpenSSL 0.9.8o since 1.0.0d introduced issues with some sites that used to work previously.</li>
							<li>Added a popup menu in search string showing Google suggestions for the currently typed word.</li>
							<li>Added a cookie policy option in URL settings (possibility to filter on both URL and cookie names with regular expressions).</li>
							<li>Added a cookie policy option in global settings.</li>
							<li>Allow deleting a cookie domain (and all its cookies) in cookie manager window.</li>
							<li>Decrease rootgroup spacing in fullscreen mode.</li>
							<li>Added FULLSCREEN REXX command.</li>
							<li>Added a fullscreen menu entry, for people lacking F11 key. :)</li>

							<li>Don't show scrollbars in video fullpage mode.</li>
							<li>Fixed a possible deadlock in MediaPlayer when the object is disposed very early.</li>
							<li>Made support for FLV and OGG optional in media settings (disabled by default), since these formats can sometimes confuse some sites like DailyMotion (refusing to play anything if OGG is available ?!), and YouTube (serving FLV in HTML5 mode ?!!).</li>
							<li>Honour the "attachment" attribute in Content-Disposition response header and force download when it's set.</li>
							<li>Implemented the necessary logic in CURL backend to upload documents in Google Docs and YouTube (it could already work before by spoofing to older browsers versions, but they're not supported anymore).</li>
							<li>Upload progress is now notified to the DOM (allows scripts to display progress).</li>
							<li>Show an appropriate status/progress and lamp for upload connections in network activity/network lamps.</li>
							<li>Fixed month display in FTP view.</li>
							<li>Make use of a FTP template page (resource/FTPDirectoryTemplate.html) to enhance the look of the FTP view.</li>
							<li>Set a proper mimetype (based on extension) for the URLs with a FTP scheme, instead of displaying them as raw text content.</li>
							<li>Fixed YouTube HTML5 fullscreen mode, since it changed again (Youtube_Fullscreen_Fix.js).</li>
							<li>Updated youtube.js userscript to work after the recent YouTube changes.</li>
						</ul>
						<div class="text_bold"><b>- 16.07.2011: Origyn Web Browser 1.13</b></div>
						<ul>
							<li>Updated to <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/" target="_blank">WebKit</a> r90337 (July 2011).</li>
							<li>Updated OpenSSL to 1.0.0d.</li>
							<li>Updated SSL certificates.</li>
							<li>Added SpellChecker library support. Dictionaries are expected in that kind of path: LOCALE:dictionaries/&lt;language&gt;/base.dic To enable spellchecker, use contextmenu in a text/textarea element and  enable "Check Spelling While Typing".</li>
							<li>Added arrows to &lt;select&gt; element default style, to differentiate it from a plain text element.</li>
							<li>Added middle mouse button scrolling.</li>
							<li>Implemented a kind of fullscreen display, triggered on/off with F11 key.</li>
							<li>Attempt to fix a problem with cookies subdomain handling.</li>
							<li>Added a media control panel (play/pause/seek/volume) in fullwindow mode (overlay). It can be hidden/shown with middle mouse button.</li>
							<li>Fixed an issue with some vimeo links that prevented videos from being played.</li>
							<li>Fixed an application deadlock that happened when closing a page while a WebM video was still in seeking phase.</li>
							<li>Fixed CSS issues in builtin media player stylesheet.</li>
							<li>Updated Youtube.js to enforce container height after recent Youtube changes, so that media controls aren't cropped.</li>
							<li>Added "OWB_DISABLE_MOBILE_COMPRESSION" ENV option to disable mobile compression (hello pampers :)).</li>
						</ul>
						<div class="text_bold"><b>- 04.03.2011: Origyn Web Browser 1.12</b></div>
						<ul>
							<li>Updated to <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/" target="_blank">WebKit</a> r80266 (March 2011).</li>
							<li>Added support for "private browsing". To enable it (on a per-tab basis), enable "private browsing" in Settings menu. Once activated, private browsing will disable any kind of data storage (history/cookies/favicons/sessions/...). Private browsing is inherited for any page created from a page in private browsing mode.</li>
							<li>Implemented per-URL settings (for plugins/images/javascript/useragent options). For instance, it could be used so that a given site is accessed under IPad user agent with plugin (Flash) disabled.</li>
							<li>Improved UTF8/local charset support for clipboard. When copying, UTF8 and local strings are copied in two different chunks, which allows legacy applications to retrieve local charset string, while OWB (and possibly other applications) make use of the UTF8 chunk.</li>
							<li>Added a clipboard monitor to address an issue with DHTML copy. After a rich-text copy,  paste would always reuse that content, even if system clipboard had been modified (externally or not) in the meanwhile. This clipboard monitor allows to reset DHTML clipboard as soon as a regular system clipboard copy has been performed.</li>
							<li>Added a "mark all matches" option in text find function.</li>
							<li>The bookmark class is not limited anymore to one level of depth. Please note that Intuition menus also have this limitation, though. So if you plan to display subfolders in menu as well, they'll be flattened, unless you use MUI menus instead of Intuition menus.</li>
							<li>Tweaked mediaplayer to work again with <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/" target="_blank">spiegel.de</a> HTML5 videos.</li>
							<li>Fixed mediaplayer autoplay that got broken in some cases.</li>
							<li>Fixed an endianess bug in WebKit shadow effect that prevented them from being shown.</li>
							<li>Adjusted font backend to show font-weight:semi-bold as bold instead of showing it as normal text (cairo/freetype backend only supports normal/bold levels).</li>
							<li>Fixed an issue with per-tab settings being reset by WebKit after a new tab creation.</li>
							<li>Fixed some possible crash with select items that were deleted from DOM at selection change.</li>
							<li>Fixed youtube.js userscript for recent YouTube changes (in fact, it could already work, with the alternative link method that could be selected in youtube.js preferences).</li>
							<li>Changed about: and error pages (contribution from Samir Hawamdeh).</li>
						</ul>
						<div class="text_bold"><b>- 05.11.2010: Origyn Web Browser 1.11</b></div>
						<ul>
							<li>Updated to <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/" target="_blank">WebKit</a> r71312 (5th November 2010). Fixes amongst other things:</li>
						</ul>
						<ul class="list_nested">
							<li>lazy loading of thumbnails on youtube and google image.</li>
							<li>crash at <a href="http://www.reco.se" target="_blank">http://www.reco.se.</a></li>
						</ul>
						<ul>
							<li>Updated to Pixman 0.20.0.</li>
							<li>Now compiled with GCC 4.4.4.</li>
							<li>Avoid redrawing a bitmap each time a data chunk is received from network. Should speed  up pictures loading time, or at least decrease CPU usage substancially.</li>
							<li>Added a workaround to avoid using "complex font rendering" code path (triggered by "text-rendering: optimizedlegibility" CSS attribute, or by fonts requiring ligatures). The complex mode is indeed not implemented in cairo/freetype font backend, which caused the sites using it to show invisible text (for instance <a href="http://www.mentor.com" target="_blank">http://www.mentor.com/</a>).</li>
							<li>Replaced the contextmenu for media elements with WebKit's own implementation.</li>
							<li>Added SELECTEDTEXT REXX command (text is converted to local charset).</li>
							<li>Added "Ignore" to the available mimetype user actions.</li>
							<li>Added Safari 5 and Opera 10 user agents.</li>
							<li>Updated youtube_fullscreen_fix.js to support embedded youtube as well (remove/readd the script to take the new URL pattern into account)</li>
							<li>In youtube.js, remove explicitely the dynamically created video element at unload event, to avoid a potential media instance "leak".</li>
							<li>Hopefully fixed some rare random crash related to a bug in reference pointers holding cairo objects.</li>
							<li>Enabled again the "death requester" in case of low memory, since it had been disabled somehow. This requester is somewhat useful, because it frees allocated memory and kills OWB in a harmless way.</li>
						</ul>
						<div class="text_bold"><b>- 05.09.2010: Origyn Web Browser  1.10</b></div>
						<ul>
							<li>Updated to <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/" target="_blank">WebKit</a> r66666 (2 September 2010).</li>
							<li>Implemented HTML5 Drag and Drop (text and images can be dragged/dropped from/to several places).</li>
							<li>Reworked login/password form detection rules to be more tolerant.</li>
							<li>Added a shortcut/keyword for search engine definition. For instance, if you have 'g' as shortcut for google engine, typing "g foobar" in URL will order a search using google engine.</li>
							<li>Enabled again CSS shadow effect, since the webkit/cairo implementation was finally made fast enough.</li>
							<li>Fixed some potential crash in WebKit when a file can't be displayed internally and that plugins are disabled or not available.</li>
							<li>Search engine string now handles input codepage correctly.</li>
							<li>"Find in page" now handles input codepage correctly.</li>
							<li>The focus ring wasn't displayed anymore after having cycled (tab key) through the whole page and re-entering it again.</li>
							<li>Filter invalid characters for downloaded filenames.</li>
							<li>Convert downloaded filenames to local charset.</li>
							<li>Added amiga+r (reload) and amiga+s (stop) shortcuts.</li>
							<li>@exclude keyword in userscripts was actually adding the sites to the whitelist too. :)</li>
							<li>Updated youtube_fullscreen_fix.js since youtube broke it (again).</li>
							<li>Removed useless user-agent checks in youtube.js.</li>
							<li>Removed dailymotion userscript, since their HTML5 player has been rewritten and now supports fullscreen properly.</li>
							<li>Added OWB_CURL_FORBID_ENCODING ENV var to disable gzip support (mostly for debug purpose, but can also help for some broken sites).</li>
						</ul>
						<div class="text_bold"><b>- 08.08.2010: Origyn Web Browser 1.9</b></div>
						<ul>
							<li>Updated to OWB r1468. To be noted OWB doesn't seem to be actively developped since May, so I'll merge directly against WebKit, from now on.</li>
							<li>Updated to <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/" target="_blank">WebKit</a> r63894 (July 2010).</li>
							<li>Updated to CURL 7.21.0</li>
							<li>Interrupt a pending DNS thread immediately when a connection handle is being disposed.</li>
							<li>Reduced the amount of Exec signals allocated for DNS resolution threads (one for all threads, instead of one per thread).</li>
							<li>Added OWB_CURL_FORBID_REUSE ENV var to disable CURL connection re-use feature (this feature sometimes causes stalled connections, for a yet unknown reason).</li>
							<li>MediaPlayer:</li>
						</ul>
						<ul class="list_nested">
							<li>Changed native controls skin and behaviour to look like Chrome's mediaplayer.</li>
							<li>Added optional support for VP8/WEBM codec (Settings->Media section).</li>
							<li>Added optional support for fast seeking (consists in creating a new connection instead of downloading everything before the target position). It can be disabled in Settings->Media section.</li>
							<li>Made the H264 loopfilter mode configurable in Settings->Media section</li>
							<li>Enabled altivec in FFMPEG (except for Theora, since it's currently broken).</li>
							<li>Disabled FFMPEG FAST flag for decoding, since it could give ugly results on some files.</li>
							<li>Added play/pause/mute/unmute/download media/copy media URL contextmenu entries for HTML Media elements.</li>
							<li>Defer audio hardware allocation until play event, and release it at the end of stream instead of waiting until media player destruction, to help a bit with people not using device.audio AHI mode. WebKit can indeed cache mediaplayer instances until tab destruction, so there are situations where audio wouldn't be available anymore.</li>
						</ul>
						<ul>
							<li>Fixed a strange cookie path restriction in OWB cookie handling, which makes wordpress.com login work.</li>
							<li>Fixed youtube.js to work with Youtube latest changes, and made MPEG4 the default format (fmt=18), instead of FLV, since it's faster and better supported.</li>
							<li>Added per-tab options in settings menu for plugins, images, javascript and user-agent.</li>
							<li>Reworked the refresh method to use several rectangles, when it's more efficient to do so.</li>
							<li>Modified the scrolling implementation to behave correctly with the WebKit recent optimizations regarding fixed elements. It also fixes some occasional glitch in custom scrollers rendering.</li>
							<li>Disabled WebKit box-shadow effect rendering, since it was extremely slow with cairo. This "cures" abnormal slowness on sites like apple.com/html5 or ign.com.</li>
							<li>Added a "remaining time" column in download manager.</li>
							<li>Added Amiga + z and Amiga + shift + z qualifier for undo/redo.</li>
							<li>Added Shift + Space shortcut as "page up" function.</li>
							<li>Added a search string in bookmark and cookies window.</li>
							<li>"Add bookmark" button now adds bookmarks below the currently selected node, or at the end of the current group list, if a group node is selected. If no entry is selected, the new link is still added to the end, like before.</li>
							<li>Allow to scroll in bookmark tree when dragging an entry over upper or lower areas of the listtree object.</li>
							<li>Added a persistant "show in menu" option in the bookmark title selection window (this window appears when dropping a link on quicklinks group or "add bookmark" button).</li>
							<li>Added a special favicon for bookmarks/quicklinks with "javascript:" scheme.</li>
							<li>Added a contextmenu to copy an entry URL in password manager.</li>
							<li>Character '&amp;' wasn't processed properly in search engine string.</li>
							<li>Truncate history/bookmark to 64 characters in pulldown menu.</li>
							<li>Moved WebInspector ENV var option to a regular setting in Prefs->Content section.</li>
							<li>Added an option to enable/disable plugins globally in Prefs->Content section.</li>
							<li>Create a new tab/window when selecting an entry in "recently closed views" menu.</li>
							<li>Added user-agents for Google Chrome, Iphone and Ipad (spoofing as IPad can help showing some sites with HTML5 Video/Audio instead of Flash).</li>
							<li>Added OWB_NO_STATIC_BACKGROUND ENV variable to ignore background "fixed" CSS attribute, which improves scrolling performance.</li>
							<li>Added notes about Youtube and the specific settings to make it work in HTML5 or at least without Flash using the builtin player. So *please* read the Youtube section of this document if you have trouble playing Youtube videos.</li>
						</ul>
						<div class="text_bold"><b>- 04.06.2010: Origyn Web Browser 1.8</b></div>
						<ul>
							<li>Updated to OWB SVN r1458.</li>
							<li>Updated to CURL 7.20.1 and implemented a threaded DNS resolver, which prevents OWB network task from being blocked until a DNS resolution is finished.</li>
							<li>Updated to PixMan 0.18.0.</li>
							<li>Implemented fullscreen mode for HTML5 video, using overlay. In this mode, the CPU usage is reduced drastically (about 300% speedup for youtube 360p content).</li>
							<li>Added a "switch to fullscreen" context menu entry for plain HTML5 video elements.</li>
							<li>Fixed some possible audio glitches due to an error in buffer management.</li>
							<li>Fixed some minor issues in MediaPlayer timeline handling.</li>
							<li>Implemented an userscript manager (GreaseMonkey-like). In practice, it means a webpage can be modified on-the-fly with a JavaScript script. In Scripts/ directory, two examples can be found:</li>
						</ul>
						<ul class="list_nested">
							<li>hello.js: a simple example to illustrate the script functionality.</li>
							<li>youtube.js: when applied to a youtube link (in Flash mode), this script adds direct links to the video, and replaces the Flash element by a HTML5 Video element. I suggest adding &amp;fmt=18 to the youtube link to play the 360p mp4 version by default. To be noted scripts are only injected to tabs/windows created after their addition in the script manager.</li>
						</ul>
						<ul>
							<li>Use MorphOS 2.x charsets.library for UTF8->local conversions (if available).</li>
							<li>Added icons for "add bookmark" and "bookmarks" buttons.</li>
							<li>Added ctrl+pgup/pgdown shortcut to cycle between tabs.</li>
							<li>Added a search string for bookmarks and history panels.</li>
							<li>Added a "copy to clipboard" contextmenu entry for network activity window.</li>
							<li>Tabs can be now be dragged too (MorphOS 2.5 required).</li>
							<li>When dropping a tab to bookmarks or quicklinks, use the site title instead of "no title".</li>
							<li>Disable gzip on-the-fly decompression when downloading gzip files.</li>
							<li>Copying UTF8 strings to system clipboard from contextmenu could result in truncated strings.</li>
							<li>Adjusted timer to postpone short requests when they are too frequent, since they could cause high CPU usage in some cases.</li>
							<li>Fixed a bug in download manager when a download connection fails before even asking for destination.</li>
							<li>Fixed some NULL pointer read access in OWB fontcache, when no fonts are found.</li>
							<li>Fixed some more minor memory leaks in OWB API usage.</li>

							<li>You can enable HTML5 in YouTube by going to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/html5" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/html5</a> and follow instructions (no account needed).</li>
							<li>Youtube broke the "fullscreen" mode just before this release. I supplied an userscript in Scripts/ to fix it: go to windows->scripts and add Scripts/Youtube_Fullscreen_Fix.js. Once it's effective, fullscreen mode will use overlay (i.e much faster).</li>

							<li>Audio output uses AHI music unit at the moment, which is unfortunately exclusive. It's still possible to play several sounds at once with this mode, by setting AHI music unit to: "Unit 0: &lt;mode&gt;".</li>
							<li>Each media instance requires one exec signal in OWB main task, which means there can be 5 concurrent media players at most (depending on other OWB options that can also eat signals).</li>
							<li>Fullscreen mode isn't implemented yet.</li>
							<li>The whole media is stored in memory (sorry for this one, it will be handled in a more elegant way later).</li>
						</ul>          
						<ul>    
							<li>Added search engine configuration window.</li>
							<li>Implemented JavaScript window modes for popups (no toolbar, no status, window size, ...).</li>
							<li>Improved keyboard support, more texteditor shortcuts work now: ctrl+a (select all), ctrl+[shift]+z (undo/redo), ctrl+b/u/i (bold,underline,italic), ... It also makes <a href="http://www.konamicodesites.com" target="_blank">http://www.konamicodesites.com</a> work properly. :)</li>
							<li>Added ctrl+wheel combination to zoom in/out.</li>
							<li>Added an option to make navigation toolbar frameless.</li>

							<li>Added dynamic frame for quicklinks in borderless mode.</li>
							<li>Added optional horizontal separators between navigation, quicklinks and address groups.</li>
							<li>Added status images for local/internet/secure/insecure areas.</li>

							<li>Reworked history popup in completion mode, so that the typed text is shown (as bold/underline) in the matching entries in the list.</li>
							<li>Added "Open all bookmarks" entry for quicklinks folder items.</li>
							<li>Added SOURCE/S argument to OPEN REXX command to open current browser source view.</li>
							<li>Added %p placeholder for contextmenu and mimetype actions, referring to OWB REXX port name.</li>
							<li>In download manager, hilight tab title instead of switching page, when a new event occurs.</li>
							<li>Allow to restart a finished download too.</li>
							<li>Changed options regarding session restoration at startup (always/ask/never).</li>
							<li>Slight adjustments in cookie parsing (fixes MobileMe).</li>
							<li>Don't show authorization window with uncomplete 401 responses.</li>
							<li>Added more checks to know if a file can actually be resumed.</li>
							<li>The form credentials saving system now allows to ignore some sites, by pressing "never" button, when asked if credentials should be saved.</li>
							<li>Hid the password column in passwords window (it can be shown with contextmenu over list header).</li>
							<li>Selecting an entry in the contextmenu of back/forward buttons no longer modifies the back/forward list.</li>

						<ul>
							<li>Enabled user stylesheet. PROGDIR:resource/userStyleSheet.css will be used if it exists. This user stylesheet allows changing default form controls look, for instance (amongst many other things).</li>
							<li>Reworked history popup list to show favicons (optionally), title and url on 2 lines.</li>
							<li>Reworked network activity window to show a more precise state (connecting/waiting/current progress).</li>
							<li>Network activity leds now show different colours depending on connection state.</li>

							<li>Fixed a memory leak with history handling.</li>
							<li>Fixed date handling.</li>
							<li>Take argument URL into account when restoring session at startup.</li>
							<li>Fixed an illegal access issue and other bugs with the new OWB cookie system.</li>
							<li>Added some memory checks in strategic places in WebKit to avoid crashing if there's not enough memory (but don't expect it to be bullet-proof anyway. WebKit is just not designed to handle properly low-memory cases).</li>
